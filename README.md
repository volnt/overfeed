# Overfeed [WIP]

Overfeed is a simple RSS reader made using Ruby on Rails.

## Features

It's possible to add / edit / remove any number of RSS feeds you want on your dashboard. However, only the five last news are displayed.

[Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) is used for user authentication and [Feedjira](https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira) is used for the feeds fetching and parsing.

## Release

The application is on [heroku](https://overfeed.herokuapp.com).
